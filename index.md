**Optics & Photonics & Laser | Computational Modeling | AI-assisted Optical Engineering**

I build models and tools for optical field propagation, focusing systems, and practical simulation workflows.
My current interests include **vectorial focusing**, **physical optics simulation**, **photonic integrated circuits (PICs)**, and **automation / AI for lab & engineering**.

## Focus

- **Physical Optics & Vectorial Field Modeling** (focusing, propagation, aberrations, structured beams)
- **Computational Imaging / Simulation Tooling** (fast forward models, benchmarking, reproducibility)
- **PIC / Integrated Photonics** (testing workflows, applications, demos)
- **AI for Optical Engineering** (assistive workflows, automation, data-driven modeling)
