## Hi, I'm Qingfeng 👋

I work on **optics and photonics**, with a focus on **vectorial field modeling**,
**computational optics**, and **AI-assisted optical engineering**.

My interests include:

- Physical optics & vectorial focusing
- Computational modeling and simulation tooling
- Photonic integrated circuits (PICs)
- Automation and AI for optical engineering
